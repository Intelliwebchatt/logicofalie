            <p>Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial expressions that occur when a person is trying to conceal or repress an emotion. Lasting only a fraction of a second—typically between 1/25th to 1/5th of a second—these subtle movements reveal what someone is truly feeling, regardless of what they're saying or how they're trying to appear.</p>

            <h2>The Science Behind Universal Expressions</h2>
            <p>Dr. Paul Ekman, a pioneering psychologist in the study of emotions, discovered that all humans, regardless of culture, language, or background, express seven basic emotions in the same way. This groundbreaking research, conducted across diverse cultures including remote tribes in Papua New Guinea, proved that these expressions are hardwired into our biology, not learned behaviors.</p>

            <h2>The 7 Universal Micro-Expressions</h2>

            <h3>1. Fear</h3>
            <p>The fear micro-expression is characterized by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and stretched lips. The upper eyelids are raised while the lower eyelids are tense. This expression signals immediate threat or danger and is one of the most primal human responses.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Eyebrows raised and pulled together, upper eyelids raised, mouth stretched horizontally.</p>

            <h3>2. Happiness</h3>
            <p>Genuine happiness, known as the Duchenne smile, involves the contraction of both the zygomatic major muscle (raising the corners of the mouth) and the orbicularis oculi muscle (crinkling the eyes). This creates "crow's feet" at the corners of the eyes—a telltale sign of authentic joy that cannot be faked.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Corners of lips drawn back and up, cheeks raised, crow's feet around eyes.</p>

            <h3>3. Sadness</h3>
            <p>Sadness is expressed through the inner corners of eyebrows being drawn up, eyelids loose, and the corners of the mouth pulled down. Unlike other expressions, sadness often lingers longer and can be more difficult to conceal completely.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Inner eyebrows raised, eyelids drooping, corners of mouth pulled down.</p>

            <h3>4. Anger</h3>
            <p>The anger micro-expression features eyebrows lowered and drawn together, eyes glaring with intensity, and lips pressed tightly together or appearing thin. This expression signals threat, frustration, or hostility and is one of the most easily recognized micro-expressions.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Eyebrows lowered and together, intense stare, lips pressed or thin.</p>

            <h3>5. Surprise</h3>
            <p>Surprise is characterized by eyebrows raised, eyes widened, and mouth opened. Unlike other expressions, surprise is brief and quickly transitions to another emotion once the unexpected event is processed. It's the most fleeting of all micro-expressions.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Eyebrows raised high, eyes widened, jaw dropped.</p>

            <h3>6. Disgust</h3>
            <p>Disgust involves the upper lip being raised, nose wrinkled, and cheeks raised. This expression is a primal response to something offensive, whether physical (bad smell) or moral (unethical behavior). It's one of the most distinctive micro-expressions.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> Upper lip raised, nose wrinkled, cheeks raised.</p>

            <h3>7. Contempt</h3>
            <p>Contempt is unique among micro-expressions because it's the only asymmetrical one. It's shown by one corner of the mouth being raised slightly, creating a smirk-like appearance. Contempt indicates feelings of superiority, judgment, or disrespect toward others.</p>
            <p><em>Key indicators:</em> One corner of mouth raised asymmetrically, slight smirk.</p>

            <h2>Why Micro-Expressions Matter</h2>
            <p>Understanding micro-expressions gives you a powerful tool for detecting deception and reading people accurately. Because these expressions are involuntary and occur before conscious control can intervene, they reveal true emotions that words or conscious facial expressions may be trying to hide.</p>

            <h2>Training Your Eye</h2>
            <p>While some people are naturally better at spotting micro-expressions, this skill can be developed through practice. Start by observing people in everyday situations—watch for fleeting expressions during conversations, negotiations, or emotional moments. Over time, you'll become more attuned to these subtle signals.</p>
